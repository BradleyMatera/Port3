## Spotify Authentication Flow Documentation

Process Overview
	1.	User Initiates Login
	‚Ä¢	The user clicks the ‚ÄúLogin with Spotify‚Äù button on the app‚Äôs interface. This action triggers the authentication process via NextAuth.
	2.	NextAuth Sends Authentication Request
	‚Ä¢	The app utilizes NextAuth‚Äôs /api/auth/signin/spotify endpoint, which handles OAuth logic with Spotify.
	3.	API Communicates with Spotify
	‚Ä¢	NextAuth sends an authorization request to Spotify‚Äôs OAuth URL. This request includes:
	‚Ä¢	Client ID (from the environment variables or .env file)
	‚Ä¢	Redirect URI (configured in the Spotify Developer Dashboard)
	‚Ä¢	Scopes (e.g., user-read-email, user-read-private, user-top-read)
	‚Ä¢	A randomly generated state to protect against CSRF attacks.
	4.	Spotify Prompts the User
	‚Ä¢	Spotify displays an authorization screen asking the user to approve access to their data.
	5.	User Approves Access
	‚Ä¢	The user grants the requested permissions by approving Spotify‚Äôs access prompt.
	6.	Spotify Sends an Authorization Code
	‚Ä¢	Spotify redirects the user back to the callback URL configured in NextAuth, appending an authorization code.
	7.	NextAuth Exchanges Code for Token
	‚Ä¢	NextAuth sends the authorization code to Spotify‚Äôs token endpoint to retrieve:
	‚Ä¢	An access token (for authenticated API requests)
	‚Ä¢	A refresh token (to renew access when the token expires)
	‚Ä¢	The token‚Äôs expiration time.
	8.	Access Token is Stored in the Session
	‚Ä¢	NextAuth securely stores the access token within the user session, enabling persistent authentication for the app.
	9.	Authenticated API Requests
	‚Ä¢	The app uses the access token from the session to query Spotify‚Äôs API for:
	‚Ä¢	User profile data
	‚Ä¢	Playlists
	‚Ä¢	Top tracks and artists
	10.	Automatic Token Refresh
	‚Ä¢	NextAuth automatically refreshes the access token using the refresh token, ensuring a seamless user experience without interruptions.
